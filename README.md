# My Personal Project
# 🧋 Bubble Tea Explorer  
*A tiny digital diary of your bubble tea adventures*

Bubble Tea Explorer is a small desktop app that lets you keep track of bubble tea places you’ve tried (or want to try).  
It’s simple, cute, and intentionally low-pressure — like a personal journal, but for bubble tea.

This project is inspired by this creator (love her energy 💕):

## ✨ What is this app?

Bubble Tea Explorer is a **desktop app** where you can:

- Log bubble tea places
- Remember what you ordered
- Rate your favourites
- Keep a “Tried” vs “Want to Try” list

It’s designed to feel small, cozy, and *very you*.

## 💡 Why this project exists

This project is both:
- a **personal diary app**, and
- a **learning project** for building desktop apps with Electron

Things I’m practicing here:
- CRUD basics (add / edit / delete)
- State management
- Local storage in a desktop app
- UI polish & small delightful interactions
- Turning a Figma design into a real product

## 🎨 Design → Code Flow

The project follows a simple, intentional process:

1. **Design first**  
   Wireframes and UI designed in Figma
2. **Learn Electron**  
   Reading through https://www.electronjs.org
3. **Build**  
   Coding the app to closely resemble the original design

The Figma designs for the map and layout are already done — this repo focuses on bringing them to life.

## 🛠 Tech Stack (WIP)

- Electron
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript  
- Local storage (no backend, no accounts)

---

## 🚧 Status

This project is currently:
- ✅ Designs completed
- 🚧 In active development

More features and polish will be added as I go.

## 💖 Notes

This app is intentionally:
- small
- personal
- slightly silly
- and very pink in spirit

It’s not meant to scale — it’s meant to make me smile.
